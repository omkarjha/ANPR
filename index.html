                    <p class="small-text">Automatic number-plate recognition is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plate.The main objective of ANPR technology is to automatically read and recognize vehicle license plates, and then extract the alphanumeric characters written in unstandardised form from the image for further processing and also along with the number plate we will get the facial recognition also.Recognising the difficulties of current market present ANPR system we have conceptualised our solution in a more universal and generic way. In our proposed solution we have rigorously used image processing, calibration, and segmentation techniques for optimised data acquisition. Moreover, we have developed an adaptive pattern-based Vehicle Registration Number Prediction (VRNP) Algorithm which is capable of real time identification of vehicle registration number with less time complexity. </p>
